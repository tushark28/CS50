# Balancing GST2b
#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
#### Description:
It is a Balancing app which has been made using python and python libraries pandas, openpyxl and database sqlite3. It can be used by Chartered Accountants in India especially to file GST returns.

What this app does is it takes two file inputs precisely excel files, first of them is a Master Book file i.e. The GST holder records his own transaction bills and second excel file is GST2b file i.e. The government forwarded file which contains all the transaction others have reported on your GST number.

So this app takes both the files as input, and then matches the data so that nothing goes unreported or unmatched and the bills that are unmatched goes to different sheets so we can look them up and take measures neccessary

We can also enter manually some margin of errors so it saves some time not to look too deep in the sheet that shows unmatched bills.

It creates pandas dataframe and then creates a sqlite database to match content. It also handles some errors to some extent.

It still have some discomforts like you have to name some column as is, The app prompts them at the start but they are very basic terms but i will still work on them in future to make this more comfortable for whoeever uses it.

thats all i have to say about this app.
